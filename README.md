# 👋 Hey, I’m Randal

I build systems that work — end to end.

Not just code that runs, but platforms that scale, survive edge cases, and make sense to the people who rely on them. I sit at the intersection of **engineering, product, and growth**, translating ideas into durable, production-ready solutions.

## 🧠 What I’m Known For

- Turning ambiguous requirements into clear, executable systems  
- Owning problems from architecture → implementation → iteration  
- Bridging technical and non-technical teams without losing precision  
- Designing for reliability, performance, and long-term maintainability  
- Shipping — even when constraints are real and timelines are tight  

I’m comfortable working across the stack, across teams, and across domains — from frontend UX decisions to backend infrastructure and data flows.

## 🛠 How I Work

- **Systems-first thinking** — I care about how parts interact, not just how they compile  
- **Pragmatic over perfect** — shipped and improving beats theoretical elegance  
- **Readable > clever** — future maintainers matter  
- **Metrics-aware** — if it can’t be measured, it can’t be improved  
- **Ownership mindset** — if it breaks, I fix it

## 🧩 What You’ll See Here

This GitHub is a reflection of how I think and build:
- Experiments that turn into foundations  
- Tools built to solve real problems  
- Code that values clarity and intent  
- Iteration over time, not one-off demos  

Some things start small. Some scale quietly. All of it is intentional.

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Building resilient, modern web platforms  
- Exploring real-time systems and media workflows  
- Improving developer experience through better abstractions  
- Designing software that supports creators, teams, and organizations

## 🤝 Philosophy

> Good software disappears into the workflow.  
> Great software earns trust and keeps it.

If you’re here to explore, learn, or collaborate — welcome.  
If you’re here reviewing code — I hope it’s easy to follow.

Thanks for stopping by.
