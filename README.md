# Randal Herndon

I build and operate digital systems that drive growth, scale responsibly, and hold up under real-world use.

My work lives at the intersection of **marketing technology, product, and engineering** — translating business goals into measurable, production-ready platforms. I’m most effective where strategy, data, and execution meet.

## What I Do

- Architect and implement marketing and analytics systems end-to-end  
- Translate stakeholder needs into clear technical solutions  
- Optimize acquisition, conversion, and retention through data and experimentation  
- Build maintainable platforms that support long-term growth  
- Bridge technical and non-technical teams without losing clarity  

I’m comfortable owning initiatives from initial concept through deployment, measurement, and iteration.

## Perspective

Good technology supports the business.  
Great technology makes better decisions easier.

If you’re reviewing this code, my goal is that the intent is clear, the tradeoffs are reasonable, and the system makes sense.
